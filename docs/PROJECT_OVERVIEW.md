# Project Overview

Last updated: 2026-10-31

This document describes **what** the product is meant to be. For **how** it is built, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For **where the work stands**, see [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md).

## Status labels used in this documentation

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Agreed** | Confirmed requirement or decision (from `CLAUDE.md`). |
| **Proposed** | Suggested but not yet approved. |
| **Implemented** | Exists in the repository and has been verified to work. |
| **Future** | Planned for a later phase; not part of the current work. |

Features that the developer has tested on a real computer are marked **Implemented** in the table below. Everything else is **Agreed** or **Future**.

## Identity

- Working project name: **Project Manager Desktop** (from `CLAUDE.md`)
- Repository and folder name: `CLAUDE.md` says `project-manager-desktop`; the actual GitHub repository is `project-manager` (an open mismatch, see [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md), Known issues)
- Product name: **Avenqor** (**Agreed** by the developer on 2026-10-25; earlier name: Project Collaboration App). Whether trademark checks were done is not recorded; the check is a 1.0 item.

## Product goals (Agreed)

Build a practical project management application where users organize workspaces, projects, tasks, deadlines, documents, and progress in one place.

- The first release targets **Windows desktop** users.
- Core features work **locally**, with no rented server, cloud account, or permanent internet connection.
- The first version prioritizes **usability, data integrity, a clean interface, and a maintainable architecture** over the number of features.
- Long term, the product may become cross-platform (Windows, web, Android, iOS) and support collaboration between people on the same projects.

## Target users (Agreed)

- University students managing assignments and group projects.
- Programming students and software development teams.
- Independent programmers and developers.
- Content creators managing production workflows.
- Small teams that need a simple way to organize projects and tasks.

The application should be easy for beginners to understand while still being useful for people managing several projects.

## Core structure (Agreed)

```
Account → Workspace → Project → Tasks and related resources
```

A workspace groups related projects. Each project contains its own tasks, deadlines, documents, and activity.

Example: the workspace "Informatics Group" could contain the projects "Final Semester Project" and "Portfolio Website".

**Roles.** The eventual role model is Owner, Admin, Member, and Guest. The data model should be designed so these roles can be added when multi-user collaboration arrives. The offline MVP does **not** include a permission system, and must not pretend to have one.

## MVP scope (Agreed; status per row)

The roadmap in `CLAUDE.md` places the MVP features in these phases.

| ID | Feature | Planned phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | **Dashboard**: workspace summary, recent projects, my tasks, upcoming deadlines, project progress, recent activity | Phase 1 (interface), Phase 2 (real data) | Agreed; interface and real data verified by the developer 2026-10-26 (local activity history verified 2026-10-29; the upcoming-deadline list is on the Calendar page, not on the Dashboard) |
| B | **Workspace management**: create, view, edit, delete; list projects in a workspace | Phase 2 | Implemented (create, rename, delete, project list; verified by the developer 2026-10-25 and 2026-10-27) |
| C | **Project management**: create, view, edit, archive or delete; description, status, progress; members as a data model only | Phase 2 | Implemented (create, edit, archive, restore, delete, calculated progress; verified 2026-10-26; members exist only as data) |
| D | **Task management**: title, description, status, priority, deadline, labels, assignee or local responsibility field, subtasks, checklists, notes | Phase 2 (create and edit), Phase 3 (details, checklists) | Implemented, except subtasks (create, edit, mark done, reopen, delete; verified 2026-10-26). Task page with description, status, and properties verified 2026-10-28 (step 3e-1). Checklists and notes verified 2026-10-28 (step 3e-2); labels verified 2026-10-29 (step 3e-3, migration 4; filtering by label comes in Phase 4); nested subtasks are not planned for the MVP |
| E | **Kanban board**: columns To Do, In Progress, Review, Done; move tasks; changes saved to SQLite | Phase 3 | Implemented: board page, move with buttons (verified 2026-10-27), and drag and drop between columns (verified 2026-10-30), saved to SQLite |
| F | **Calendar and deadlines**: calendar view, upcoming list, overdue versus upcoming | Phase 3 | Implemented (month grid, upcoming list, overdue versus upcoming; verified by the developer 2026-10-28) |
| G | **Project documents**: notes, requirements, meeting notes, API references, UI/UX decisions | Phase 3 | Verified by the developer 2026-10-29 (step 3f, migration 5): plain-text documents of five types per project, a Documents page with search by title and filters, and a Documents section on each project page. Attachments and search inside the text are Future (Phase 4 or later) |
| H | **Progress and activity**: completion statistics computed from stored data, local activity history | Phase 3 | Implemented: progress is calculated from real task data (verified 2026-10-26); local activity history (step 3g, migration 6) verified 2026-10-29, shown as Activity on the Dashboard, project page, and workspace page |
| I | **Templates**: reusable project or task templates, where practical | Not scheduled in the roadmap | Agreed, not started |
| J | **Backup and restore**: JSON export and validated import, format version, no silent overwrite | Phase 4 | Implemented (step 4a, verified by the developer 2026-10-30): export of all data to a JSON file, validated restore that replaces all data after a mandatory safety backup. Merge mode and automatic or encrypted backups are not planned for 1.0 |
| K | **Local notifications**: deadline reminders once the core is stable | Phase 4 ("where appropriate") | Written 2026-10-31 (step 4d, awaiting the developer's test): one daily reminder for your tasks that are due today or overdue, only while the app is open; settings kept in the web view's storage |

Search and filters (search box in the top bar verified 2026-10-31; task filters on the project page awaiting test), error handling and validation, and testing are also listed for Phase 4.

### Rules that shape the MVP

- Progress must be **derived from stored data**, not arbitrary percentages.
- There is **no real-time collaborative editing** in the offline version.
- Local data on one computer is **not shared** with other computers.
- Attachments are not part of the current documents. Importing files into documents is planned after 1.0 (see "Documents as files and folders"); the scope of templates is not decided.

## Deferred (Agreed: do not prioritize)

Real-time cross-device sync, cloud accounts and authentication, online chat and live presence, full multi-user collaboration, AI assistant integration, complex enterprise permissions, large-scale analytics, and anything requiring paid infrastructure.

## Future roadmap (Future)

| Phase | Goal |
|---|---|
| 5 | **GitHub integration**: connect a repository to a project; show repository information, commits, pull requests, and review status where the API allows. Needs internet access and secure authentication. Tokens must never be committed. |
| 6 | **Online architecture**: authentication, backend API, cloud database, synchronization, conflict handling, offline-to-online data migration, shared workspaces. |
| 7 | **Platform expansion and AI**: evaluate web, Android, and iOS options; add AI-assisted features only when justified. |

Tauri does not automatically produce a complete mobile application. Mobile options will be evaluated when that phase begins.

## Version 1.0 and the plans after it (Future; details Agreed 2026-10-30)

**Order of work (Agreed 2026-10-30).** First finish the application up to release **1.0**. Only after 1.0 does the developer decide whether to build the mobile version first or to update Documents and the Whiteboard. Nothing in the two sections below is built before then, and the details may still change when that work starts.

**Scope of 1.0 (Agreed 2026-10-30):** Phase 4 complete (backup and restore, search and filters, validation review, local notifications); drag and drop on the Kanban board (step 3b); release preparation (a tested installer, the decision on the database folder now in Roaming, trademark check of the name Avenqor, customizing the installer and uninstaller). **Not in 1.0:** GitHub integration (Phase 5) and online features (Phase 6).

**Installer and uninstaller look (Agreed as a 1.0 item 2026-10-30; not started).** Tauri's NSIS installer (the `-setup.exe`) can be customized in `tauri.conf.json` under `bundle > windows > nsis`: header and sidebar pictures (`headerImage` 150x57 px, `sidebarImage` 164x314 px), installer and uninstaller icons, a separate header picture for the uninstaller, the language list, the Start Menu folder, and a hooks file (`installerHooks`) or a full custom template for more. The MSI installer has fewer options (banner and dialog pictures). The pages and layout of the NSIS wizard cannot be redesigned freely without a custom template, which is more work. (Source: the Tauri `NsisConfig` reference, read 2026-10-30.)

### Documents as files and folders (Future)

- Documents become **files** with a format and are shown as a **tree of folders and files** like a GitHub repository, **separated by workspace**.
- Creating a project **automatically creates a folder** with the project's name inside its workspace. Only that folder is automatic.
- One compact "New" button offers **New folder** and **New file**. Folders may contain folders, and files may sit directly at the top level of a workspace.
- Formats: `.md`, `.txt`, `.html`, and others. **`.md` has two modes: editing the raw text and a rendered preview.** Other text formats have raw text editing only.
- Files can be **imported from the computer**. PDF and image files have **preview only**. Imported files are stored **inside the SQLite database** (BLOB), so there is one data file and backups stay simple. A limit of **10 MB per file** with a clear message (Agreed). Trade-offs noted: the database grows, JSON backups become large, and large files are slower to read through the SQL plugin; `CLAUDE.md` asks to avoid large binaries in the database unless there is a clear reason, and the developer's reason is a single data file.
- Today's documents (step 3f) are **migrated to `.txt` files** in their project's folder, and each file **keeps its type as a tag** (Notes, Requirements, Meeting notes, API reference, UI/UX decision).
- Deleting a project **does not delete its folder**: it stays as an ordinary folder in the workspace with all its contents. When the project is renamed, the folder name follows while it is still linked. Moving a project to another workspace **moves the folder and its contents**. Deleting a workspace deletes all its folders and files, after a confirmation that names the number of files.
- Open for later: how `.html` is shown (as code, or rendered, which needs a security decision), and how the SQL plugin copes with 10 MB files (to be tested before building).

### Whiteboard (Future)

A simple whiteboard in the spirit of Miro or FigJam.

- **One whiteboard per workspace.** The canvas is **unlimited** (pan in any direction) if technically possible, has a **square grid background** (one cell like a spreadsheet), and can be **zoomed** in and out.
- **Sticky-note widgets** (text), resizable with a **minimum of 2x2 cells**, draggable. They can be connected to other widgets with **arrow lines or "cables"** (right-angled arrow lines).
- **Flowchart items** are a separate kind of item from sticky notes, inspired by the software Flowgorithm: the basic shapes (start/end oval, input/output parallelogram, process box, decision diamond, loop) joined with right-angled cables with arrowheads.
- **Icon items** for the target audience (students, programmers, networking): server, database, PC, laptop, phone, router, switch, firewall, cloud, user, folder, code (Agreed list; may grow).
- **Links in a widget:** typing `@` and a project or task name shows suggestions and creates a link that opens that page. When the task or project is deleted, the link becomes plain grey text.
- Also wanted: **undo/redo, selecting several widgets at once, and widget colors**.
- Stored in the **database** (positions, sizes, content) and included in backups. **Export to an image is postponed**, to be done later if hard.
- Open for later: the canvas library (a technical decision with long-term consequences, to be explained and approved before building), and how many whiteboard features fit a first version.

## Design reference (Agreed)

Figma concept: <https://www.figma.com/design/K22NNL2AkbZKjRDMzPXn7c>

Direction: clean, modern desktop interface; light theme; DM Sans typography; indigo accent; sidebar navigation; clear spacing and hierarchy.

Screens in the Figma file: Dashboard, Workspace, Project Board, Project Overview and GitHub, Mobile Dashboard, Calendar and Deadlines, Task Details, Project Documents, Local Data and Backup. The GitHub and Mobile screens are references for **future** phases, not MVP work.

**Note:** the Figma file was inspected only through its structure (frames and names); screenshots could not be downloaded in Claude's workspace. Since 2026-10-22 the design is a reference, not a binding specification, and each deviation is mentioned when it happens.

## Open questions (Proposed or undecided)

These need a decision before the related work starts.

- Whether the trademark check of the name Avenqor was or will be done (the name itself is Agreed).
- The scope of templates (feature I).
- Whether file attachments are supported: planned only through the Documents update after 1.0.

Decided since this document was first written: the product name (Avenqor), Tailwind CSS (used), database access (the Tauri SQL plugin, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)), and the local profile (one profile stored in the database).

## MVP success criteria (Agreed)

The MVP is successful when it runs as a Windows desktop application; core project and task features work offline; data persists locally in SQLite; the interface follows the Figma direction; users can organize workspaces, projects, tasks, deadlines, and documents; data can be exported and restored safely; no rented server is required; the code is understandable and maintainable; and future online features can be added without rewriting the whole application.
